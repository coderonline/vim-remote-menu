# vim-remote-menu

This plugin helps to work with multiple monitors by providing a menu to send a file from one Vim instance to another.
This allows for having multiple Vim windows open, even on several monitors and can be seen as an extension to the native
editexisting plugin.

Screenshots will follow.
